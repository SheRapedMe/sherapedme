<h1>My Landlord, Shelley Palmer, Raped & Abused Me for 10 Months, Then Her Dog Bit My Nose Off</h1>

<p>For the second time in a year, I am <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="camp">homeless in Richmond, Virginia</a>, surviving on SNAP assistance eaten in the grocery store and finding occasional shelter on Tinder when the weather turns foul. This is not my first time escaping abuse - it’s come from parents, partners, landlords, and doctors all my life. The last time it was this bad was in 2018 when my dog, dignity, and all my belongings were stolen as revenge for speaking out. This year, I’ve lost my nose, my final ounce of trust for women, and all my belongings again.</p>

<p>RVA's Homeless Connection Line intake number is a voicemail box I’ve been calling since November 2022, among many other organizations: VCU’s EmpowerNET, Daily Planet, Catholic Charities, RBHA, CARITAS, Central Virginia Legal Aid, Safe Harbor, VA Abuse Action Alliance, YWCA, Bon Secours. They’ve all been mostly useless, just passing me off to the next, or worse, are complicit in some of the abuse and trauma. They tell me I was raped and human trafficked but then ghost me when I ask for help reporting it.</p>

<p>Last autumn, this lack of safe options led me into an abusive living situation with Shelley Palmer, a 36 y/o RVA homeowner and dietician at Glenburnie Nursing Home we will refer to as Landlord. After multiple public meetings and a pinky promise we wouldn’t have sex, I visited Landlord’s home but didn't spend the night, explaining I have narcolepsy, have been taken advantage of due to waking sleep-paralysis, and am thus self-conscious about sleeping around new acquaintances.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="onesies">Landlord convinced me to sleep over,</a>, suggesting we <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="promise">wear onesies as a gesture of her promise</a> and mentioning how unsafe being outside was. When I arrived that September evening, <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="outfit">she provided me with an outfit</a> that exposed my penis through a hole in the front while Landlord’s had a removable covering in the rear. When I questioned her motives, she said, “a promise is a promise” and “what’s the alternative?”</p>

<p>We both knew it was far too late and ugly outside for me to come up with secondary sleeping arrangements this far out into the suburbs. While we ate and watched TV, I stalled and limited what kissing and touching Landlord initiated that I could. Eventually, the drugs and drink Landlord kept offering and pushing meant cataplexy took over. The next day I had few memories of getting into bed, showed clear signs of PIV intercourse upon my body, and left Landlord’s home as quickly as I could.</p>

<p>Later, I <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="jokes">received jokes about the onesies</a> and sex from Landlord <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="denial">and her friends as if the promise had never existed.</a> I was also told <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="nudes">nude photos of my body and close-up photos of my erect penis were shared with Landlord’s friends and coworkers</a>, people I had never met, in a manner that suggested I should feel proud.</p>

<p>As a last resort, I checked myself into the hospital emergency room where I lied about not wanting to live in order to get food, shelter, and meds. Inside HCA, I told doctors and social workers there about what some people on Tinder had done to me; nurses made sexual comments about the contents of my bag and while watching me change. I was discharged a week later with no safety plan, only another phone number that had never heard of me when I called, and like all others, had no beds.</p>

<p>That same night, Landlord invited me to stay permanently, again saying things like “what’s the alternative?”. Over the next 10 months, this would become her catchphrase for instilling fear and helplessness, especially when explaining how I would be homeless and starving otherwise. In 3 months of calls all I had managed was 3 nights in a crack motel billed to my Medicaid, so without another option, I said yes. I still managed to resist moving in all my belongings, computers, and keepsakes all, for another month, mainly because Landlord’s dog was dangerous and destroyed everything.</p>

<p>One evening before the holidays, Landlord came home from work and quickly downed over a dozen shots of tequila then yanked my clothes down while I was cooking and shoved my penis in her mouth, causing the worst cataplexy episode I’ve had in recent memory. Landlord's drug abuse was frequent and extended to prescription opioids and muscle relaxers. <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="drugs">She even bullied an ex-FWB into giving her pills</a> that Landlord admits almost put her in the hospital psych ward.</p>
    
<p>After that incident, I realized survival was my only goal and resolved to put on a facade for my own safety, "consenting" only to what I thought or was told would keep a roof over my head. I focused on my mind’s health, plugging into Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, where I reported some of Landlord’s abuse and received jokes in return from my assigned psychiatric nurse. RBHA then cut me off from my meds when I reported this to the VDHP.</p>

<p>The rapes,<a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="rape">especially while I was asleep</a>, abuse, and forms of control from Landlord continued and are too numerous to list. The most common was forcing me to flash my penis only to endure objectifying comments. She would stop the car on a public road and initiate sex, knowing I had no choice but to argue or comply. I got really good at faking orgasms.</p>

<p>Naturally, I did all the cooking, cleaning, animal care, and other errands for Landlord. My SNAP assistance was used to buy the food. My <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="disability">disability application has been pending medical review for almost 300 days</a> (countless on-foot vehicle collisions, two GSWs and a stabbing, narcolepsy with cataplexy, arthritis and asthma, as well as ADHD, cPTSD, et al). Big home projects like plumbing, building a patio, etc were also my responsibility despite these disabilities.</p>

<p>Any work I was allowed to do was either for her or her friends. All the wages were paid directly to Landlord, I would then get to keep half or less, most of which I used to buy cannabis to numb the pain. I was often told my payment for <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="payment">work I did wasn't going to be paid at the previously agreed rate, but blowjobs.</a> Any conversation about having an official lease agreement or her constant violations of my consent would result in a fight, almost always with her dog in the room.</p>

<p>Fights about my libido and erectile dysfunction became more frequent after the New Year when I started sleeping in a spare room with the door locked, blaming it on Landlord’s snoring. I was pressured to interrupt my just recently stable medical care milestones in order to ask for pills to help with sexual performance, including texting my doctor’s personal phone number and explaining the situation plainly to my pharmacist. This fiasco, along with pressure to go off my ADHD and PTSD medications for the ED and “those meds make you an asshole” behavior, led me to lose all medical care, even desperately needed dental appointments.</p>

<p>Only Landlord’s friends were allowed in the home, who became the only people I was allowed to hang out with. Many saw me naked, or made comments about threesomes and other uncomfortable jokes, without my consent and with Landlord's approval. Anyone I spoke about meeting or remained in touch with that Landlord didn’t introduce me to risked constant ridicule and threats out of jealousy. <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="threats">Store clerks and restaurant servers that showed any amount of friendliness towards me would receive muttered threats of having their hands cut off or worse.</a> It felt impossible to make friends and keep them safe from Landlord and her dog.</p>

<p>Last month, Landlord was showing me a “funny chomping trick” of her dog when my glasses were knocked off and my face was bitten. <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="nose">My nose had to be sewn back together at Chippenham ER</a> where she begged not to have a report made because she's owned dogs under bite restriction before. From the moment I was brought to a room to leaving the hospital, I wasn’t left alone for a single second with anyone from the hospital that I could tell the truth to. I kept asking for no drugs but they insisted. In the following weeks, <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="charged">the dog has repeatedly charged and attacked me again</a>, which <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="legs">led to further injuries</a> and me spending most of my time in the locked guest room and our breakup two weeks later when Landlord got so drunk she lost her glasses and needed to be driven home, screaming at me the whole trip.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, when she discovered I was talking to attorneys, domestic abuse hotlines, and even her ex-husband about reporting her abuse, <a href="#" class="image-link" data-image="courts">Landlord manipulated the courts in order to have the police illegally evict me in the middle of the night</a>. I’ve been without medication or hygiene products, wearing the same clothes and making more excruciating calls to all the previously mentioned organizations ever since. It’s the same dead end with police and magistrates, who laugh when I constantly correct their assumptions that my rapist is male. Landlord has texted me, violating the protective order, but because she lied before I could tell the truth, I am ineligible for assistance.</p>

<p>I feel alone and disregarded. The systems that promise help don’t know what to do with a male victim. Until I get lasting therapy and medical treatment, I fear I’ll continue to end up in abusive situations. But how can I build that foundation alone and barely surviving, desperate to escape one hole and blind to the newest and more dangerous pit right in front?</p>

        <p>Thank you for reading. Stay safe!</p>>
